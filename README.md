The title of my project is "Data Mining Techniques for Diagnosis of Diabetes using Classification technique". 

Firstly we use WEKA, a data mining tool to analyse the data of its data set taken from UCI repository and they are applied with preprocessing steps to reduce noisy data & remove missing values. 
Secondly we go with two classification technique called Naive Bayes and J48 algorithm to classify which one is having more correct accuracy of data.
